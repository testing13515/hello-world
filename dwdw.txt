HK form questions



1. suspicious case to sales not CS? Conflict of interest? -> Yes but we do not have any CS in HK.
2. Record keeping - 7 years -> Source
3. Why use CPI instead of FATF? Any rationale behind?  -> Company policy
4. Joint account - Risk assessment same as individual account? Yes 
5. AML Risk rating: Criminal record/adverse report - Do we need to include it in the HK manual? 
Not all criminal records would be rejected/classified as high risk -> Leave some spaces for decisions
6. AML Risk rating: ADS blocked countries should be classified as banned? Not high risk? How about UN sanctioned  

- No united rules for blocked countries
- Leave some space for our decision purpose
- The FATF black list is not included in ADS blocked list. Countries such as Iran are banned for other reasons

7. What need to be done for high risk client? Approval from senior management or other additional measures? 
    -> The signature in the form is regarded as approval already.

But we haven't done the AML risk assessment when the RO signed on it.
